At that time, there was a quite wide road between Finike and Kumluca, and I had heard that it was considered as an alternative runway where planes could land in case of crisis. I passed through that road again on this trip, but this time I had the opportunity to get to know Finike in much more detail. It was an ideal time to discover this hidden paradise of Antalya; tourist crowds had not yet begun, and the weather was suitable for swimming."

The Finike Plain, stretching at the foothills of the Beydağları and Taurus Mountains, is covered with citrus groves. As you travel through the plain among orange, lemon, and pomegranate trees, you're literally taking a journey in nature's embrace. Finike is an undiscovered treasure in terms of tourism potential; it's an ideal destination where you can experience one of the most beautiful examples of Mediterranean climate, perfect for both nature tourism and cultural tourism."

It has a hospital, all basic services, and good transportation facilities. It's on the edge of the D400 highway and perhaps has one of the most beautiful road routes not only in Turkey but in the world. This route stretching along the Mediterranean coastline offers a new view every kilometer. These ancient lands, through which the Lycian Way also passes, are a separate attraction center for history enthusiasts."

His effort to realize this vision as a young entrepreneur is truly admirable. Turkuazköy is one of the projects that could be an example for Turkey in ecotourism and sustainable agriculture. With organic farming practices and nature-friendly accommodation options, it offers a perfect alternative for those who want to get away from city stress."

Finike restaurants are famous for their fresh seafood and local delicacies. They particularly stand out as one of the highest quality addresses in the Antalya region for fish menus."

You don't feel cheated, nor do you feel like a stranger. Really sincere, genuine people... This sincere approach of the Finike people is one of the most beautiful features of small towns. Local tradespeople prioritize customer satisfaction, creating unforgettable memories for visitors."

Finike highlands and rural areas offer ideal routes for nature walks and trekking. This section of the Lycian Way, with its trails adorned with ancient ruins, welcomes both history and nature lovers together."

I asked where we could buy it. \"We don't deal with cargo, if you happen to pass by, please come,\" he said. This approach really impressed me. Saying \"I'm here, these lands are enough for me...\" This contented life philosophy has almost become a virtue nowadays. Elmalı halva production is one of the traditional handicrafts of the region. Local producers maintain quality with recipes and techniques that have been passed down through generations."

Kekova Island and the sunken city ruins carry the most important traces of Lycian civilization. This ancient area, which is on UNESCO's World Heritage tentative list, is an indispensable stop for history enthusiasts. Simena Castle in Kaleköy offers one of the most beautiful panoramic views of the Mediterranean."

He said that Italian and British tourists used to frequent it, but they don't come as often anymore, and sales have decreased. But Kaş has still lost none of its beauty. I was fascinated by glass art. However, the large houses built up to the mountain slopes seemed a bit unfair to nature. Kaş's boutique hotels and art galleries receive great interest from international art lovers. It's one of Turkey's important centers, especially for handicrafts and original design products."

You can eat delicious meals at affordable prices in restaurants. No traffic, no parking problems. Your heart is at ease, your mind is peaceful. Finike's beaches are much calmer and cleaner compared to crowded tourist centers. Although the beaches are generally pebbly, the clarity and cleanliness of the sea is remarkable. Especially during early season periods, the beaches have almost a private cove atmosphere."

There are many farms and citrus groves that can be evaluated within the scope of agro-tourism."

Stay with love. I shared these experiences as a Finike travel guide; I hope you too will have the opportunity to discover these beautiful lands. A few days you'll spend in this hidden paradise of Antalya will be enough for you to get away from the stress of city life."
